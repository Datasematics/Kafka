Problem Statement: 
Use Kafka producer to fetch data and insert nto kafka topic.

Tags :
KafkaProducer,  schema.registry.url , Avro, Topic and pom.xml

Use cases: 
The Producer API allows applications to send streams of data to topics in the Kafka cluster.

Description :
Producer consists of a pool of buffer space that holds records that haven't yet been transmitted to the server 
as well as a background I/O thread that is responsible for turning these records into requests and transmitting 
them to the cluster.

Execution Steps:
Pre requisites :
1. java 1.7 
2. maven 3.3.9 

Project requires a pom.xml file to download all the dependencies and to execute this  pom.xml file enter the following commands
     i)	mvn  package   (will download all the dependencies from pom.xml file)
    ii)	To execute any java program  go to  the target directory folder and type
     ->	java –cp “kafka*.jar:dependencies/*” classname  
   iii)	kafa-topic --zookeeper localhost:2181 –list    //check broker list to match the topic name in code 
   
Note : Before you execute this code make sure topic is created in kafka if not follow the below commands to create topic.
i)	To the confluent kafka bin folder 
  -> ./kafka-topic –zookeeper locolhost:2181 –create  –topic topic_name –partitions 1 –replication-factors 1
ii)	To list the created topic 
  -> ./kafka-topic –zookeeper localhost:2181 –list
